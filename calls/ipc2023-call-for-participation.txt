               2023 International Planning Competition

                        Call for Participation

======================================================================

The International Planning Competition is organised in the context of the
International Conference on Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS). It empirically
evaluates state-of-the-art planning systems on a number of benchmark problems.
The goals of the IPC are to promote planning research, highlight challenges in
the planning community and provide new and interesting problems as benchmarks
for future research.

The deterministic part of the IPC is the oldest one; the 10th edition will run
in 2023 and conclude together with ICAPS, in June 2023, in Prague (Czech
Republic). 

IPC 2023 will encompass a number of tracks: classical planning, numeric
planning, probabilistic planning, HTN planning, and learning. Each track will
use fragments of PDDL3.1, HDDL or RDDL; more information is given track by
track in the following links:

Classical Planning: https://ipc2023-classical.github.io
HTN: https://ipc2023-htn.github.io
Learning: https://ipc2023-learning.github.io
Numeric Planning: https://ipc2023-numeric.github.io
Probabilistic Planning: https://ataitler.github.io/IPPC2023

In each track, there may be subtracks, such as optimal planning, satisficing
planning and agile planning. A competing team may participate for any track, so
competitors are strongly encouraged to participate in every track supported by
their planners. Details regarding the rules and evaluation criteria of all
tracks can be found at the competition website.

As in previous editions, the competitors must submit the source code of their
planners that will be run by the organisers on the actual competition
domains/problems, unknown to the competitors until this time. This way no
fine-tuning of the planners will be possible.

All competitors must submit a short summary (max. 300 words) and a planner
abstract (max. 8 pages) describing their submission. After the competition, we
encourage the participants to analyse the results of their planner and submit a
revised version of their abstract. An important requirement for IPC 2023
competitors is to give the organisers the right to post their paper and the
source code of their planners on the official IPC 2023 web site.

Registration and Schedule
------------
Further details on how to register and how to submit planners will be provided
on the homepage corresponding to the track. Potential participants are
requested to follow the instructions on the website of each track they are
interested in. Note that all tracks also have their own schedule.  We are
looking forward to an exciting competition!
